# Yago 4.5

<img src="https://yago-knowledge.org/assets/images/yago-logos/yago-logo.svg" align="right" height="100"> YAGO is a large knowledge base. In this version (4.5), YAGO combines the ontology of Schema.org with the data from Wikidata, most notably the Wikidata taxonomy. This GitHub repository contains the source code that generates YAGO from Wikidata. It is of use only for people who want to build YAGO themselves.

If you are mainly interested in using YAGO, please see the [Web page of YAGO](https://yago-knowledge.org).

## Building YAGO

The creation of YAGO proceeds in 6 steps, which each corresponds to one Python file. Run the steps sequentially.
